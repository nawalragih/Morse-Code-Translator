# Morse-Code-Translator
This Java program implements a simple Morse code translator. It allows users to either encode text into Morse code or decode Morse code back into text. The program presents a menu where users can choose between these options using keyboard input ('t' for text encoding, 'm' for Morse code decoding, and 'e' to exit). It utilizes arrays to map characters to their corresponding Morse code representations and vice versa, providing a basic yet functional utility for Morse code conversion. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, making it interactive and user-friendly for translating text using Morse code and vice versa.
